Please note I am always hands on, always in addition to doing\nthe architecture I do coding, do DevOps, and do my own developments and\nPOCs. This was a complex hybrid multi projects with Kubernetes, Big Data,\nMulti-cloud (Azue, AWS and GCP), MapR, Kafka, Confluent, SOLR,\nElasticsearch etc. It was for an important Microsoft client, a multibillion\ndollar company in New York with Petabytes of data, and 10 terabyte\nstreaming and data ingestion a day:\n\nI was involved with multiple Kubernetes projects, a hybrid of MapR and\nmulti-cloud system with a massive MapR cluster (with 1400 note 16000 CPUs)\nand Multi-Cloud project (Azure AWS and GCP) with cloud Migration, Kafka\nConfluent streaming using Kappa with massive amount of data in Petabytes\nwith real time streaming using Kappa architecture. This project among\nothers included a comprehensive Data Pipeline, multiple Data Lakes (Landing\nZone, Processing Zone and Consumption zone), high level of domain Join\nsecurity, Big Data Visualizations, Machine Learning, Deep Learning (CNN\nRNN). The architecture that we created is similar to Uber Gen-4\narchitecture with Hudi capable of processing tens of petabytes of streaming\ndata. Please note that due to confidentiality and sensitivity I cannot and\nwill not reveal specific technical details.\n\n    . I lead, architected and helped developing multiple Kubernetes projects\n      on multiple large Kubernetes clusters. Initially we created POCs on\n      AWS (EKS) and Azure (AKS) but finally decided to use the Google\n      Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in GCP for a number of reasons (more than\n      welcome to ask me why in the interview). We created multiple clusters\n      and deployed HDFS Spark in Kubernetes (up to 1000 pods), Kafka\n      Confluent in Kubernetes (created both but decided on using pure Kafka\n      up to 30 pods brokers in Kubernetes), Zookeeper in Kubernetes (up to\n      30 pods ZK), a comprehensive SOLR cluster in Kubernetes (50 SOLR\n      pods), Elastic Search in Kubernetes (50 pods Elasticsearch) and other\n      orchestrations. Please note that due to the StatefulSet nature, these\n      projects were fairly complex using headless services for HDFS, Kafka,\n      Zookeeper, SOLR, Elasticsearch etc however after deployments they were\n      very reliable, scalable. For example with one replica command change\n      in Helm Chart it would go from 5 node to 30 brokers Kafka in minutes.\n      Could index from inside the dataproc into the SOLR kubernetes in a\n      lightning speed. Used other component of the GCP among others Cloud\n      Dataproc, BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Data Fusion, Cloud Dataprep,\n      Data Catalog, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Kubernetes CLusters,\n      Dataproc CLusters, Container Registry, CI/CD (CICD, CI CD,CI-CD)\n      pipelines, Deep Learning Containers, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL,\n      Firebase Realtime Database. For artificial intelligence used AI\n      building blocks, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, AutoML, Vision AI,\n      Cloud Natural Language, Video AI, AI Platform, AI Hub and AI Platform\n      Deep Learning VM Image etc.\n    .

A comprehensive Data Pipeline with data\n      ingestions from variety of sources RDBMS, hardware logs, images,\n      streaming data, files, documents into the Data Lake. Using Confluent,\n      Kafka Confluent both inside Kubernetes and outside, Kappa architecture\n      with schema evolution, Avro, Parquet (similar to Uber Gen 4\n      architecture) we were able to ingest tens of terabytes of data a day\n      like a charm. The Big Data part used Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka\n      Confluent on mainly MapR but also interacting with Azure HDInsight,\n      AWS EMR, and Kubernetes Cluster. Used also, Spark, Spark Streaming,\n      Storm, Kafka Confluent, Hive, Pig, Impala, Flume, Sqoop, MapReduce,\n      Pig, HBase, NiFi, oozie, Tableau Power BI and, Oozie, QlikView etc.\n      Most of the code were written in Python, PySpark and Scala.\n    .

I lead, architected and helped developing a Big Data system with 256\n      nodes using Hadoop, Spark on Hortonworks and later migrated to\n      Cloudera, Storm, KafKa, Hive, Pig, Impala, Flume, Sqoop, MapReduce,\n      Pig, HBase, oozie, Tableau Power BI and Cloudera visualization,\n      QlikView\n    . Development languages, extensive Scala SBT (my preference), Java\n      Maven, Eclipse Intellij, Python, R, PySpark, Ruby, C#, Unix Shell\n      Scripts, Linux Shell Scripts\n    . I lead, architected and help developing the SOLR/Lucene Search system\n      which was later migrated to Elasticsearch with 15 nodes sharding. The\n      system was initially developed and maintained in house but later\n      deployed to AWS cloud and prototyped on Azure. The development and\n      test of the 15 node done on VirtualBox machines, physical machines\n      before deployment to the Cloud. The SOLR development was done in two\n      different phases, initially we did indexing directly on top of the\n      metadata extracted from various files with Apache Tika, Apache Flume\n      and scoop. I wrote a scheduler in Java that run delta indexing\n      periodically every few hours. We had customized faceting and then the\n      API would grab the top N results from the XML. The search worked\n      better than expected, the indexing was slow but the search was\n      extremely fast in fraction of a second. On the second phase we stored\n      all the raw documents in HDFS and create indexing and then use HBase\n      to store the index files in HDFS. Also an API was developed in JAVA\n      with a .NET wrapper with SOLR search calls into the SOLR engine.\n    . I lead, architected and help developing an advanced Machine Learning\n      system initially in Spark MLlib then Weka and ultimately a Mahout\n      Machine learning and recommendation system using both ItemSimilarity\n      and UserNeighborhood. I personally favored and created porotypes using\n      Spark MLlib, TensorFlow, Keras, Python libraries like scikit-learn,\n      Pandas but in this case Mahout worked very well. The .NET API would\n      record every time a product was clicked or purchased. The data was\n      recorded in the database and then the metadata was created and the\n      mahout would create a scoring table (0-10) for product and region. The\n      .NET API would select top N highest score and would present it as\n      recommendations.\n    . I lead, architected and helped developing a gigantic amount of data\n      extraction, data warehousing, Big Data. The data was gathered in\n      access of tens of terabytes from more than 40 top of the lines brands\n      Ecommerce sites partnered and operated by OneStop like FRYE, Juicy\n      couture, NYDJ, PAIGE, Splendid, Coffee Beans, Jones New York, Hudson\n      and many more. Used SSIS ETL for SQL to port data to the Data\n      Warehouse and then used Sqoop for extracting from RDBMS to the HDFS,\n      used Flume for extracting from logs files, FTP NAS files to the HDFS,\n      used Apache Tika and Java for extracting metadata from various files\n      into the HDFS, used Nutch for web crawling and for extraction metadata\n      into the HDFS, used SAPI, CMU Sphinx, Kaldi for customer service voice\n      to text conversion into the HDFS\n    . I architected and implemented a real time and streaming component for\n      the Cloudera visualization using Apache Strom and Apache Kafka.\n    .
