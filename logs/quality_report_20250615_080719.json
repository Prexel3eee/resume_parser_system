degrees and awards and helps the NLM management track their career development at NLM.\nThe system was originally developed in ASP and is in use for over 15 years.\nSupport for some components such as Crystal Reports and Windows 2003 are no longer available.\nThe system lacked user interface improvements due to the proliferation JavaScript and lacked important data security measures such as data encryption and secure login.\nResponsibilities: Convert ActiveX Based Crystal Reports to .NET Implement sensitive data encryption in the database Implement LDAP based authentication Implement XSS and

integrate into electronic health records (EHRs), personal health records (PHRs), and mobile health apps.\nLForms is a completely free widget toolkit that leverages LOINC's rich content model for panels, forms, and survey instruments.\nDeveloped by LHNCBC in collaboration with the Regenstrief Institute, LForms can read any of the 1,700+ panels defined in LOINC\u00ae and render a powerful data entry form.\nIt works across all the domains (laboratory panels, survey instruments, etc.) included in LOINC.\nLForms power comes through its support of detailed form attributes, including: data type, cardinality, default value, units of measure (if numeric), answer lists (if multiple choice), ability to make multiple choice answer lists function as \"select one\" or \"select all that apply,\" relationship (in a nested hierarchy) to other questions, default value settings, validation checks, skip logic and help messages.\nResponsibilities: Develop node js based REST services that serves data stored in the elastic index to the user.\nThe rest services can be customized to return specific fields only Develop ElasticSearch based indexes.\nThese indexes are tuned to maximize response time and handle high volume traffic Implement Elasticsearch based search on the Gene Index.\nCreate a Shell script using tools such as AWK, sed, sort and such to de-duplicate, group, truncate and sort
